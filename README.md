The first step is to input a Company into the system. To do so, the user needs to have three pieces of data: Company Name, Contact Name, Contact Email. These three items are mandatory. Additionaly, the user can enter address information.

After the company is created, the user can view, edit and delete the information if needed. A list of companies ordered by name is also displayed with a search bar that filters by company name and city.

After creating a company, the user can enter the invoice information. All the invoice fields are mandatory. They are: Invoice Number, Due Date, Amount ($), Company, and Department.
